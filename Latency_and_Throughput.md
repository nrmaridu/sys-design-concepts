# Latency and Throughput

- [Latency](#latency)
- [Throughput](#throughput)


Latency and throughput are the two metrics that measure the performance of a computer network. The network speed is determined by looking at how quickly a network can transfer data packets to their destinations. The speed is the result of network performance factors like **latency** and **throughput**.

A network with **low throughput** and **high latency** struggles to send and process high data volume, which results in **congestion** and **poor application performance**.


## Latency
- Latency is the delay in network communication.
- It shows the time data takes to transfer across network.
- In terms of user experience, the latency is the delay a user experiences when they send or receive data over the network.




## Throughput

- In terms of user experience, throughput determines the number of users that can access the network at the same time.
